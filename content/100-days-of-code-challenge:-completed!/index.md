I completed the 100 Days of Code Challenge where I spent at least one hour coding for 100 days (in a row!!!). I originally started learning to code this year because I wanted to be able to customize the design of a blog I wanted to create. Now I’m hooked! Below is a recap of everything I have accomplished during the past 100 days.

### What I Learned

I started the challenge with some beginner knowledge in CSS and HTML. Now I have the ability to build complex web applications. Below is an outline of some of the various frameworks, tools and languages that I learned during the challenge.

**HTML** (Slim, Pug)

**CSS** (Sass, Neat, Flexbox)

**JavaScript** (Vue.js, Node.js, jQuery)

**Tools & Backend** (Git, Github, MongoDB, REST APIs, Heroku)

**Testing** (Test Driven Development, Travis CI, Postman)

**Design** (Mobile First Design, Wireframing, Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, Sketch, Affinity Designer)

### What I Created

#### CSS Images

One of my favorite projects was the [Daily CSS Image Challenge](http://challenges.codingartist.io/daily-css-images/), which was created by [Michael Mangialardi](https://twitter.com/michaelmangial1). You sign up via email and receive prompts each weekday such as bear cub, keyboard, and so on, and are challenged to create a CSS image inspired by the prompt. You can [take this free course created by Michael](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) to learn how to make CSS images.

\*note: GIFs might take a minute to load.
