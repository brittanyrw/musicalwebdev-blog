### The Idea 

1.  Initial idea when learning how to code — reviews of all shows
2.  Showcase CSS & SVG animations— only fav shows
3.  Then wanting to learn Vue — hey, now I can combine this! 

### The Data

### The Prototypes

Theater shell

Interactive Javascript prototype

Charts — FAIL. I wanted to show some kind of chart in the ‘statistics’ section of the project. The first ‘level’ of the building. I have always wanted to learn d3 but realized that it was a little much for just one chart and also it was annoying trying to figure it out — for one chart. So I switched to Chart.js. Super easy to set up but it did take a while for me to figure out how to make the exact chart that I wanted to make because of course I wanted to do things that weren’t included in the library. And then — the chart looked dumb so I scraped that idea. 

### The Planning

Lists. Lists. More lists. I had already gone through and listed (almost) every show I have seen since 2014. But I also needed a solid list of each floor of the building and illustration ideas for each show. 

#### Scope

Connecting to Firebase. And oh, maybe also connect it to Google Sheets. But then I remembered that I actually wanted to finish this project. CSS images vs SVG images. How to update my list. Simple JSON bby.

### The Wireframes

Adobe XD — old friend, used for every project I have made so far. Why over Sketch? Simple. Great for quickly blocking out ideas without getting bogged down in details. I always plan out the layouts before I start coding, especially if they are complex. 

### The Ilustrations 1

As you can tell by now, I like trying things out before going all out on a project. I took the list I made earlier and made some quick hand-drawn (because it’s waaaay faster) drawings of what I was thinking. Initially I was thinking that all illustrations would be completing in CSS but scraped that idea because I want to actually finish this project in this century. I decided that the building could easily be built using HTML and CSS only, and the show illustrations. That would keep each of the illustrations relatively simple. But the backdrop of each level for sure needed to be SVG. 

I took the three most recent shows I saw and mocked them up in CSS. I also made the first floor backdrop. This is to get an idea of how long it takes to make each one and try to solidify some kind of style and color palette. Definitely wanting to check do I like how this looks.

### The First Draft

I got my sample images and sample backdrop. Now it’s time to put it all together into a clean, final first draft to see how everything looks together and address any UX issues. Will ITbe annoying to scroll forever? Maybe I’ll add a back to top button or something. Maybe I’ll get fancy and filter stuff. Who knows.

### The Illustrations Part 2

Knocked out all of the remaining illustrations.

### The Finishing Touches
