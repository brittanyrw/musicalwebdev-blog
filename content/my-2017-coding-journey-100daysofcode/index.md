### Introduction

To start this year, I will be taking part in a 100 Days of Code Challenge. For more information on that challenge check out [this blog post by Alexander Kallaway](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b?source=linkShare-3ace071df08b-1483456287). The challenge will be a great way to help get me started on my 2017 coding journey. The plan is to expand on the coding challenge and learn everyday this year. I will [commit to Github daily](https://github.com/brittanyrw/100-days-of-code) and I will also be posting a weekly summary blog post here on Medium.

My experience with coding started when I was I the 8th grade. I taught myself HTML and CSS making guild pages for an online game and dabbled with coding on and off in the years after. Starting in November 2016, I started to get serious about learning how to code again. I will be following a few guides and tutorials during this challenge, which will be listed below in the tools section.

### Previous Knowledge

I am going into this year with some knowledge of HTML and CSS. In the last two months of 2016, I started to learn Javascript and Ruby.

I’ve been working on courses from Codeacademy, CodeSchool, Treehouse, Udacity, Khan Academy and various free bootcamp prep courses and other online tutorials. I am currently working through [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/brittanyrw), this [web development guide](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516) and [Launch School’s Backend Prep Course](https://launchschool.com/).

### Tools

Below are a list of the tools I am currently using. As my journey progresses, I am sure more will be added to the list.

#### General

-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
-   [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) (an iOS note taking app)

#### Learning

-   [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) (and following this [web development guide](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516)).
-   [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/)
-   [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/)
-   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

#### Social

-   [Slack](https://slack.com/) / [Gitter](https://gitter.im)
-   [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)

### Calendar

My first project will be to create a website to house a simple calendar. This calendar will track my daily coding activities as well as list all resources that I have used, events I have attended, the number of projects I have completed and how many hours I have spent learning. It will basically be a visual representation of my logs in the 100 Days of Code repository.

In the meantime, I will list the estimated activities for the first week in this introductory blog post.
